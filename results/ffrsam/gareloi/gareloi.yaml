# Example configuration file for tsdatacruncher
# YAML format
# You can override values in this file with command line arguments

## Data source settings
# This parameter will create an ObsPy Client. Options include FDSN Web Services, Winston Wave Servers, SDS Filestructure,
# and SeedLink connections. Examples:
# client: "IRIS"                             # FDSN shortcut mapped by ObsPy (https://docs.obspy.org/packages/obspy.clients.fdsn.html)
# client: fdsn://service.iris.edu:18000      # FDSN Web Services
# client: wws://127.0.0.1:16022              # Winston Wave Server
# client: seedlink://127.0.0:18000           # SeedLink Server
# client: sds:///home/sysop/var/lib/archive  # SDS filesystem of miniseed data
client: "IRIS"


## Time range settings
# if t1 & t2 are both provided, data will be processed between t1 & t2
# if t1 & t2 are both None, data will be processed between now - 'tproc' & now
# if only t1 is provided, data will be processed between t1 and t1 + 'tproc'
# if only t2 is provided, data will be processed between t2 - 'tproc' and t2
t1: None
t2: None


## Station IDs
# Station.channel pairs to process. By default, stations are provided as a list in YAML format.
# Alternatively, stations can be supplied as a comma-separated list. E.g.:
# id: "AV.GAEA.--.BHZ,AV.GALA.--.BHZ,AV.GASW.--.BHZ"
#
# Stations can also be specified in a separate text file where each station is provided on a separate line.
# Text files can inlcude other files by specifying the relative path after the '@' symbol. See example below:
#
# id: './station_list.id'
#
# # station_list.id
# AV.GAEA..BHZ
# AV.GALA..BHZ
# AV.GASW..BHZ
# @more_stations.id
#
# # more_stations.id
# AV.GANE..BHZ
# AV.GANO..BHZ
#
# tsdatacruncher will ignore comments marked by '#', and it will remove duplicate station IDs if one is provided
# multiple times.
id:
  - "AV.GAEA..BHZ"
  - "AV.GALA..BHZ"
  - "AV.GASW..BHZ"


## Frequency Bands
# These are the frequency bands that will be processsed.
# None must be explicitly included in order to produce RSAM for the raw, unfiltered seismic data.
# Alternatively, freq can be provided as a comma-separated string. E.g.,
# freq: None,0.1-1,1-3,1-5,1-10,5-10,10-15,15,20
#
# The frequency band will be converted to a string to create folders to store the output. E.g.,
# 0.1-1 is written as 0010-0100
# 1-10  is written as 0100-1000
# None  is written as 0000-0000
freq:
  - None
  - 0.1-1
  - 1-3
  - 1-5
  - 1-10
  - 5-10
  - 10-15
  - 15-20


## Processing time settings
# These settings determine how much data is downloaded at once and how large of chunks are made with the for loop.
# This is NOT the rsam_period. These values can be given as integers of minutes or as Pandas Timedelta strings.
# For example, by default, no matter the value of t1 and t2, tsdatacruncher will split the download into day-long
# segments (always rounding down to the start of a day). It will then loop through each hour of data in that download
# to produce 1 minute RSAM before moving onto the next hour. After all 24 hours are processed, the next day of data will
# be downloaded.
# tsdatacruncher never tries to download or process more data than necessary. For example, if t1 to t2 is only 10 minutes,
# only 10 minutes of data will be downloaded, even if 'tload' is 1 day.
tload: "1D"     # Maximum amount of time to download in one chunk
tproc: "1h"     # Processing time window length (minutes)
tstep: "1h"     # Time between processing chunks (minutes)


## Output SDS directory
# RSAM data are stored as miniseed files in the SDS filesystem. One channel of data at 1 minute sample rate should be
# about 12KB.
# 'archive' is the top level directory of the SDS archive. The first subdirectory created will be for each frequency band.
# Then the standard SDS syntax (https://www.seiscomp.de/seiscomp3/doc/applications/slarchive/SDS.html) is used. E.g.,
# ./results/ffrsam/SDS_ffrsam/0000-0000/2025/AV/GAEA/BHZ.D/AV.GAEA..BHZ.D.2025.001
archive: "./results/ffrsam/SDS_ffrsam"


## Output settings
# Location of log file and log-level. So far, only log-level "INFO" is used.
# Overwrite is not yet used.
overwrite: False
log_file: "./results/ffrsam/gareloi/gareloi.log"
log_level: "INFO"
